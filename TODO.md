* SceneBase can extend JavaFX Scene, so workflow with Scene as variable and then setting it at the end of constructor can be skipped
* Win / lose / draw system
  * Pop-up with information which player win
  * Play again button
* GUI rework
  * Gameover windows icon

BUGS:
  * when Piece is promoted to King and can beat next piece, theres no moves that this piece can do and game is frozen
  * Closing windows sometimes dont close process
  * White king is darker than Man
